This document is an AsciiDoc book skeleton containing briefly
annotated example elements plus a couple of example index entries and
footnotes.

Books are normally used to generate DocBook markup and the titles of
the preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and index sections are
significant ('specialsections').

Optional preface.

Preface Sub-section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Preface sub-section body.


The First Chapter
-----------------
Chapters can contain sub-sections nested up to three deep.
footnote:[An example footnote.]
indexterm:[Example index entry]

Chapters can have their own bibliography, glossary and index.

And now for something completely different: ((monkeys)), lions and
tigers (Bengal and Siberian) using the alternative syntax index
entries.
(((Big cats,Lions)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Bengal Tiger)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Siberian Tiger)))
Note that multi-entry terms generate separate index entries.
